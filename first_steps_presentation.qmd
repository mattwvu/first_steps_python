:::

## Cells

Unit where you can write and run code, document their work, and format outputs.

There are three main types of cells:

1.  **Code Cells** -- For writing and running Python code.
2.  **Markdown Cells** -- For writing formatted text (like headings, lists, links).
3.  **Raw Cells** -- For displaying unformatted text or data.

## Entering Data

In Python, you can work with data by defining variables, lists, or other data structures. Let's start by entering some data and practicing basic operations.

## Lists

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

```{python}
#| label: enter list
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

my_var = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_var)

```

## Functions

used to give commands to perform a tasks.

<img src="toolbox.png" alt="toolbox" width="25%"/>

<br>

```{python}
#| label: example function
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

round(3.141592653589793)

```

## Arguments

used to provide the details about how your function operates

<img src="pizza.png" alt="pizza" width="55%"/>

<br>

```{python}
#| label: example_arguments
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

round(3.141592653589793, 5)

```

::: notes
arguments in python as the ingredients or details you provide to a function, like telling a chef how to prepare your food. These arguments help customize what the function does, and the function's output is like the dish you receive based on your requests.
:::

## Documentation

provides the necessary information, explanations, examples, and guidance to help you learn, understand, and effectively use R functions and packages.

<br>

-   [Base Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
-   [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
-   [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

## Getting Help in Python

1.  **Help with Functions and Libraries**
    -   Use the `help()` function to get information about a function or library.

```{python}
#| label: help
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

 help(print)  # Get help on the print function
   help('pandas')  # Get help on the pandas library

```

## Variables

used to store and work on data (numbers, words, tables, and more).

<img src="drawer.png" alt="drawer" width="55%"/>

::: notes
"object" is a fundamental concept that can be thought of as a container or a holder for data. Just like in everyday life, you use different containers like bags, boxes, or drawers to store and organize your things
:::

## Creating and Using Variables

### Example 1: Storing Numbers

```{python}
#| label: variable example
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Storing an integer
age = 25

# Storing a floating-point number in Fahrenheit
temperature_fahrenheit = 100.6

# Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius
temperature_celsius = (temperature_fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9


print(age)
print(temperature_celsius) 


```

## Naming Objects

-   Use descriptive and meaningful names that indicate the purpose of the object
-   Use lowercase letters.
-   Use underscores to separate words (e.g., my_variable_name).
-   Avoid using reserved words or functions (e.g., "if," "else," "for," "function").

## Data Types in Python

::: r-fit-text
| Type        | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integer** | Represents whole numbers. Example: `5`, `-3`, `42`.                                                 |
| **Float**   | Represents real numbers (numbers with decimal points). Example: `3.14`, `-0.001`.                   |
| **String**  | Represents text, words, and strings of characters. Enclosed in double (`"`) or single (`'`) quotes. |
| **Boolean** | Represents binary values used for decision-making. Typically `True` or `False`.                     |
| **Date**    | Handles dates and times. Use the `datetime` module. Example: `datetime.date(2024, 9, 13)`.          |
:::

## Comparisons and Boolean Operators

Use comparison operators to determine if objects in python are identical to each other.

Equal ( == )
Not equal ( != )
Greater than ( > )
Less than ( < )
Greater than or equal ( >= )
Less than or equal ( <= )

```{python}
#| label: comparisons
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#Comparison

fruit1= "apple"
fruit2= "orange"

#Are items/variables == to each other
fruit1 == fruit2

```

## Conditionals

::: r-fit-text

Python operators that looks to see if an object meets stated conditions and will then run operations based of those determinations.

If = If the conditions made in the statement are met then perform the operation.
Else = If the conditions made in the statement are NOT met then perform another operations.
Elif = If the condition made in the statement are NOT met by either the IF statement or the ELSE statement perform this operation.

```{python}
#| label: conditionals
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

water_cold = True

if water_cold:
  print("Brrrrrr")

if water_cold:
  print("Brrrrr")
else:
  print("I can drink this)

water_temp = 0

if water_temp < 0:
  print("Brrrrrr")
elif water_temp > 100:
    print("tccchhhhh")
else:
    print("I can drink this")


```

## Loops



## Packages & Libraries

packages are like toolkits or collections of pre-built functions, data sets, and tools that extend the capabilities of the R programming language.

## Packages

<br>

#### Install

You must install a package before you can load it. *But you only need to install it one time.*

```{python}
#| label: install packages
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

!conda install pandas

!conda list

```

<br>

## Explore your Environment

```{python}
#| label: environment
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# see

!conda list

# search

!conda search beautifulsoup

# update

!conda update beautifulsoup4

```

#### Import

Using import for a library will bring all functions for the library into your workspace

```{python}
#| label: import
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

import pandas as pd

# Example: Reading a CSV file with pandas
# Assume we have a 'data.csv' file
data = pd.read_csv("customer_reviews.csv")

# Display the first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())   # Output: 3.141592653589793

```

## Sequence Types

ordered collections of data items of the same type.

[Python Documentation - Sequence Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)

|              |                                                                                            |                                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tupples      | A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.                                 | (1, 2, 3, 4)                               |
| Sets         |  A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.                    | {1, 2, 3, 4}                               |
| Dictionaries | A dictionary is a collection which is ordered\*, changeable and does not allow duplicates. | {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3:value3 } |

## Dictionary

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered\*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.

```{python}
#| label: example_dictionary
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

country_roads = {"Morgantown": 30847, "Charlestown": 45879, "Reedsville": 603, "Huntington": 44934}
print(country_roads)

```

## Series

Like a dictionary in the standard library, a series from Pandas allows you to store key-value pairs in python.

```{python}
#| label: example_series
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

import pandas as pd

series_example = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
series_example
```

## Data Frame

A **Pandas DataFrame** is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure. It is composed of:

-   **Variables** (or columns), which represent the data types.

-   **Observations** (or rows), which represent individual data entries.

Each variable (column) in a DataFrame typically contains data of the same type (e.g., integers, strings). However, different variables can contain different data types.

<br>

```{python}
#| label: create data frame
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

import pandas as pd

# Creating individual Series for each column
year_series = pd.Series([1977, 1980, 1983], name="Year")
title_series = pd.Series(["Star Wars", "Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi"], name="Title")
length_series = pd.Series([121, 124, 144], name="Length")  # Movie length in minutes
gross_series = pd.Series([787, 534, 572], name="Gross")  # Gross revenue in millions

# Creating the DataFrame
starwars_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Year": year_series,
    "Title": title_series,
    "Length": length_series,
    "Gross": gross_series
})

# Displaying the DataFrame
print(starwars_df)

```

## Subsetting Variables

used to select and work with specific variables (columns) from a data frame.

<br>

```{python}
#| label: subsetting
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

starwars_df['Title']

mean_length = starwars_df["Length"].mean()

# Displaying the result

print("Mean Length of Movies:", mean_length)
```

## Explore Data Frame

```{python}
#| label: explore_data
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# data values

starwars_df.dtypes

# summary statistics

starwars_df.describe()

# shape 

starwars_df.shape


c
```

## Export / Save Data

Once you are done entering your data, you can export it to your working directory. The function without built-in arguments is **write.table( )** but if are saving it as a csv, you are better using **write.csv( )**.

<br>

```{python}
#| label: export files
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Exporting the DataFrame to a CSV file
starwars_df.to_csv("starwars.csv", index=False)
```

"Nov 16, 2023",Donald F.,5,Went up to see the daughter in Morgantown! Wanted something nice to eat.. found this place... was not disappointed.  Food and service was outstanding.  Highly Recommended
"May 3, 2024",Marianne D.,3,The bartender was amazing and he made really good drinks. The food was awful!!!I will go back for drinks but I will never order from the menu.
"Jul 29, 2023",Brooke T.,1,"Shown are the appetizers of Cheesy Nachos with prime filet add on. Was not impressed with this at all. Cheese was just microwaved on. Asked for no peppers (due to allergy) and all that cane out was nachos, cheese, and steak. The steak was def not prime filet. It was well done, super difficult to chew and tasted like scraps from a steak. Very disappointing and not worth the cost. No substitute was ever brought out for my pepper allergy. So this place does not do accommodations for food allergies. Cheese logs were a favorite of mine but they were brought out ice cold and the cheese was hard. Not pull apart at the mouth. The breading was pretty good though and had lots of flavor. Next is the chipotle burger. We ordered it medium rare and came out well done. Very small burger. Fries/chips were not bad. But this dish had way to much salt added. Ambiance was pretty tachy. Lots of empty high end liquor bottles scattered all of the restaurant for decoration and they were all dusty. Lot of loud people with nothing in the restaurant that absorbs sound. Seemed that a lot of older folks were there eating. Inside was pretty cold, so bring a jacket. Wait staff was friendly but didnt know the menu well at all. Overall i do not recommend this restaurant."
"Feb 17, 2024",Sara L.,3,"We walked in and immediately felt under dressed, but we rolled with it.  Ordered the Greek sampler to start - it was okay.  My theme for the night was everything was pricey for what you get and it started with the appetizer.  The best entree was the porcini truffle ravioli - the chipotle cream sauce was tasty, but sweet and not spicy at all.  The blackened shrimp was far from blackened and had very little seasoning, but cooked well.  My husband and son both ordered honey salmon and said it was okay, but the skin was limp.  My other son had a chipotle burger and enjoyed it, but said it wasn't anything special.  My daughter had the ceasar salad - well dressed and fresh.  For the money, I'd recommend plenty of other options in the area.  The biggest plus was the waitress - she was attentive, not pushy, and there when we needed something."
"Mar 12, 2024",Jen G.,5,"Food was great. Service wonderful. One of the better places in Motown hands down. Our group had steak, pasta, sushi and all were fantastic. Great happy hour as well"
"Jan 24, 2024",Rachel N.,1,I put in a to go sushi order today including a salmon sashimi and a rainbow roll. The roll had an excessive amount of rice and the topping looked like they were just thrown on there. The sashimi I ordered was also very slimy. I normally love the sushi at Bartini but something about it recently has just not been up to par.
"Dec 17, 2023",Maddie D.,3,"Super busy restaurant, kitchen was slow. The food was just okay. The sushi looked good. Ordered the smothered chicken and it wasn't what the description said. High end restaurant not that high end of food. Just okay."
"Feb 20, 2024",Landon R.,1,"DO NOT EAT HEREAbsolutely Horrible, would definitely rate a zero if i could. Came here on a Tuesday with a reservation and the experience was absolutely horrendous. Ordered chicken nachos as an app and they came out cold and without the bell peppers and corn, as well as the chicken looking microwaved and like plastic. Waited 15 minutes for the server to come up  with our entrees just to be told they were out of the bell peppers and corn. Our Steak and Cake was way over cooked (well done on a medium) and the crab cake tasted expired and cold. Had the Porcini and Truffle Ravioli, shrimp were not blackened but rather boiled and tasteless. The ravioli themselves were great but ruined by the sour tasting sauce. Ambiance was poor overall. As servers, we are usually not ones to complain but the service coupled with the horrid food definitely makes this a place we will no longer go. DO NOT EAT HERE. Paying 120 dollars for possibly the worst dining experience you will ever had is not worth it."
"Dec 14, 2023",Lori P.,3,"We chose this restaurant because our son LOVES steak and was really missing a good steak dinner while at college. The place has an upscale feel and the servers are very attentive. We ordered nachos and a sushi roll for appetizers. The nachos were unremarkable (even my son, who is normally excited by any nachos was not really impressed at the lack of toppings and flavor- was basically chips, cheese and chicken). I didn't even take a picture of it, though you see a glimpse in one of the photos I did take. The sushi roll was excellent- beautiful presentation and delicious. I ordered a filet and crabcake combo and my son got a filet. He did not make any remarks about his steak, which was prepared to requested temp (a task some places seem to struggle with). Mine was simply bad. It was literally cold, had no flavor and I took one bite and moved on to the crabcake, which was ok but not up to my Maryland standards. This reminds me why I don't order crabcakes away from home. My husband got sushi and aside from accidentally eating the whole wasabi portion in one bite, was thoroughly pleased with his meal. Bottom line of my review? Drop the steaks, focus on the sushi. There's definitely something worth pursuing there. Will return but won't go for anything else there again."
"Jan 24, 2024",Sarah B.,1,"I came specifically for sushi tonight and the sushi was not good at all. Too much rice and the rice was also very overdone, sushi was falling apart when I tried to pick it up, and the toppings were falling all over the plate. It was impossible to eat. Service was amazing, Jacey did a wonderful job taking care of us tonight and the host was very welcoming. Other than the sushi being awful, my experience was delightful."

"Jul 9, 2023",Jen K.,2,"We were excited to hit one of our favorite restaurants when we came to move our daughter home for the summer.  We enjoyed our appetizers, then soon order our main courses.  We ordered 2 prime ribs (medium),  2 filets (one med, the other med rare).  The waitress came back and said they didn't have any prime ribs.   Ok, so they got the filets, then a little later she comes back and says they only have 6oz filets not the 10oz we had ordered.  Ok, fine but when they came out they were ALL cooked well done.  Left disappointed because this use to be a great place.  We did go a few months ago and noticed some changes but brushed it off bc they were busy.  Sadly, this will be our last time."
"Aug 10, 2023",Veronica C.,5,Went for dinner after moving my son back to WVU. I sat at the bar which is very pretty and comfortable. I was lucky to be there during happy hour. Bar tender Angelo was friendly and gave very good service. Had the steak and cake- both were delish. I would definitely return.
"May 23, 2020",Joey D.,5,"Birthday dinner 5/22. One for the records. I never would have guessed in a million years , living in NY, I would have to travel 7 hours to Bartini Prime in Morgantown, WV to have a steak dinner.  NY closed its doors but West Virginia opened them. Wife said it was the best steak she ever had. I also was very pleased all around. Waitress (Kayla) I think , was great. I thank governor Jim Justice for opening up the state to visitors when my state was closed. Instead of a birthday that would have been curbside and watching Netflix on the couch, I had a great steak at Bartini Prime! Thanks to all Bartini PrimeJim Justice the governor And the state of West Virginia."
"Jul 21, 2023",Lisa K.,1,"Extremely small portions and way over-priced for sushi and dessert.  I ordered a ""specialty roll"" from for $14- the rainbow roll.  I asked how many pieces and whether I should order a 2nd to complete my meal.  Good thing I did!  These were the tiniest sushi rolls pieces I've ever gotten in any restaurant!  I also got the Philly roll- $9.  Each roll was equally small.  In total, the pieces might have been 5 or 6 inches per roll stacked together.  Each piece was the size of a quarter at best.   My friends ordered steak.  One ordered the filet medium- it was definitely medium-well or well done.  I ordered tiramisu- that was enclosed in a paper wrapper and also super small.  This restaurant doesn't live up to its hype or it's price tag.  Will not return or recommend!"
"Jun 20, 2019",Heather B.,2,"Stopped here for dinner - it was just average.  Employees were very friendly but the food was just meh.We ordered the crab dip, it was good and did have quite a bit of crab meat. Entrees were 100% disappointing. The steak and cake entree featured very little food for the $34 price - My hamburger was extremely dry and overcooked, lacked any decent flavor.  Didn't finish it.  The sweet potato fries were, I believe, covered in sugar - I don't want extra sugar on my food.  The garlic mushrooms were meh. All in all, not worth the $93 price tag.  Had better burgers at local joints.  Again, employees nice but food was lackluster.  Plus, doors to outdoor seating were left open so we had a fly buzzing around us while we tried to eat.  Not good."
"Oct 10, 2021",Richard H.,3,"One of the best crab cakes I have ever eaten! Well I got tastes from my wife's plate after sending my overcooked and over seasoned steak back. I ordered the dry aged steak and was very disappointed, but my bride's meal was wonderful. The staff was both attentive and willing to go the extra mile to make the experience good but a poorly cooked meal is tough to recover from.  the replacement was better but still not great. The atmosphere was a mixed message, the waitresses uniform included very short skirts, the music was what I would expect in a dance club, and the patrons were, for the most part, well north of 50 years old. The price point is $$$+ and one would expect an atmosphere befitting both the clientele and the expense."
"Jun 26, 2022",Noelle M.,5,"Not only is this restaurant's food amazing, but their workers are too! Joanna was an amazing and kind waitress. She made sure we had everything we needed when we needed it. Shoutout to Vlad, he's awesome too. I highly suggest this place, I wish I could eat here every day!"
"Oct 14, 2022",Crystal D.,5,Great service and phenomenal food. Highly recommend the crab cakes or steak and crab. Great wine and bourbon selections.
"Apr 28, 2022",Ron B.,4,"I went with a group of people. Food, drink and service  was excellent. This is one of the best restaurants in Morgantown. Absolutely the best crab cakes in area- nothing comes close."
"Apr 28, 2022",Rusty D.,4,"You will think you are in a big city instead of smaller town West Virginia. A nice surprise. The weather protected outdoor seating is rare in ""Mo'town"". Other choices are Oliverios and Gibbies. I hear the Mason Jar is adding outdoor seating this year too."

"Jul 3, 2022",Craig H.,2,Disappointing experience. Expected much more based on other reviews. Food was average at best and over priced compared to other restaurants. Drinks were over priced and were horrible. Service wasn't the best. Environment had a night club vibe... and not a good one.
"Feb 12, 2022",J C.,4,"Nightclub type atmosphere with great food. steak are featured and always quite good. Great drink and wine menu. The service is very good and waitresses very easy on a guys eyes! Can be noisy for table conversations so in warm weather try the outdoor dinning room. A locals favorite. Make a reservation. Located in a shopping plaza, parking is easy."
"Sep 3, 2022",Krista C.,2,"Out of several things on menu. Served last bowl of potato soup and it was half full and consistency of mashed potatoes. Chicken nachos were chips, nacho cheese and uncooked chicken. Tuna on sushi was dry and for some sushi lovers, inedible. I'm used to paying upwards of $60+ for a good cut of meat and this place was very overpriced."
"Jul 14, 2018",Rachael M.,5,"If I had the money to come to this place every night, I absolutely would. The atmosphere is perfect; soft, subtle lighting high above the dark wood tables, music loud enough to hear clearly but not so loud you have to tell at your table partners to be heard. The staff were all all warm and welcoming, and Kelsey, our server, was on point. She came often enough to make sure we had everything, but not so often I felt like we had a third wheel. Then comes the food, oh the food!! The two of us both got sushi, and shared the Greek Sampler and Au Gratin Potatoes. Everything tasted fresh, packed with flavor, and absolutely amazing. I was a little nervous getting sushi from a restaurant that also does steak and has a full bar (I.E. is not a sushi restaurant), but I was blown away. Thus may be my new sushi place, especially since it is similarly priced. Lastly, the drinks. Huge drink menu, and all of the drinks we got were STRONG and flavorful. Absolutely worth every cent. Expect to pay roughly $30-50 per person, but also expect it to be worth every penny."
"Nov 14, 2016",Jason J.,4,"Nice atmosphere, good service and a good happy hour. My only real complaint is the cost. A basic California roll from anywhere else is $5-6, but here it is $8.50 and they nickel and dime everything. If you want some siracha or spicy mayo that will be .50 cents each.A ribeye with blue cheese was $34, no sides no anything.. $34 and that's all you get is the steak. The ribeye was good, the dang rolls are the best sushi roll they have and the Greek app was good. Overall a good place to grab a bite, but I think they really need to look at their price points."
"Mar 14, 2021",Eric G.,5,"We had a great evening out with friends celebrating a birthday. The food was delicious, the service was spot on, the drinks were made just as requested and in today's Covid environment the restaurant was extremely clean and spaced out. Highly recommend. Thanks for having us Bartini Prime!Eric and Darlene"
"Aug 7, 2018",Sarah K.,3,"While in town on business, I stopped in for for a light meal and a drink. Upon entering the door, I was taken aback by the staffs' attire; it was pretty sleazy. The heels and too short black dresses on the women staff were quite revealing and made me uncomfortable. The man at the door had his shirt unbuttoned a little too far down, a gold necklace, and no undershirt...ick. I sat down and ordered anyway. I ordered a ""Sexy"" cosmo and Philly Roll.Even though it wasnt very busy, the Philly Roll took 25 minutes to arrive. It was pretty good, worth the price. Overall, I wouldn't come back. It seemed like a place to hire an escort - the women staff were objectified, not dressed classy and refined like the restaurant appears to advertise. Yuck...made me feel sad for the women who work there."
"Aug 16, 2021",Jeremy A.,5,"We were in town to drop our daughter at WVU, and wanted a memorable ""last"" dinner last Saturday evening, 8/14.  We were not disappointed.  The restaurant was modern, airy and very comfortable. Izzy our server was friendly,  knowledgeable and professional. The service was attentive and our beverages and food arrived promptly.  We had tuna poke bowl, Prime californoa sushi roll and a cheese steak. All meals were fresh, delicious and very reasonably priced, especially given the large portions. We can't wait to go again during Parents Weekend!"
"Sep 30, 2018",Tiffany N.,4,"Sigh, I will Suncrest Towncenter was around when I went to WVU, it has it all! I was quick pleased with our dinner and drinks at Bartini Prime, it's a terrific option for the older people in town or if you're looking for something more refined. We went on a Friday night and if you're going with a big party, definitely make a reservation! Service was on the slower side but they had a lot of drink options so that made the time go by quickly. I was surprised with the sushi, I found a few rolls without cream cheese and went with those. It was great! The only thing I didn't like was that the sushi station is right near the door which skeeves me out from a germ perspective. Their menu is varied and theres little something for everyone!"
"Apr 28, 2018",Erika K.,4,"This place is pretty great! My friend took me here because she was raving about their sushi. To be fair, I'm from the Bay Area, California so I'm a little biased when it comes to sushi. But the sushi was still so delicious! I ordered the Mountaineer roll to be spirited since Morgantown thrives off of the University here. I love the comradely feeling the university creates in this (once) small town. I also ordered the grapefruit crushtini. The martinis are a little sweet for my liking, but for the average person I would say they're a go! My friends tried out the dragonberry lemonade crushtini (the favorite of the group), orange crushtini, and the peach ring martini. The service was excellent. Emily was our server. My water was ALWAYS full. The manager came by to ask us how everything was tasting and how we we're doing. I thought that was very personal and important. The ambiance was great. I love the openness of the restaurant and the dim lighting. Apparently this place turns into a club after a certain time. Sounds like so much fun!!"

"May 25, 2021",Jean M.,1,After being seated on a Tuesday evening we ordered two simple drinks - a Scotch on the rocks and a Sangria. Twenty minutes later with no drinks in sight we left. Wonder how long an actual cocktail takes?
"Oct 15, 2021",Wv M.,1,"""NOT"" accommodating to those with seafood allergies or vegetarians. Left hungry and paid way too much for what we did eat. Attitude is what we were served, not very appealing."
"Sep 3, 2015",Lurine J.,4,This place was ok the sushi was great and the service was fantastic. It is not as upscale as some mad it out to be. However I guess for Morgantown it's good enough. The place is convo energy located in a nice shopping center. I think the martini drinks are great!!! I am glad that we have this place . It will more than likely be our go to place for date night
"Sep 2, 2017",Rob G.,2,"Shiny TurdThe place ""looks"" great. Nice web site, online reservations, well dressed attractive servers. After that, eh. It is billed as a steakhouse. The presentation was nice, but the steaks were very subpar. Overpriced, overcooked on the outside undercooked in the middle. Glad I didn't order medium. The price for the steak was INSANE and didn't come w any sides. I ordered coffee w cream and sugar and wasn't provided a spoon to stir it with. My wife ordered coffee a few minutes later, still no spoon. The ONE upside, the sushi was actually good, and reasonably priced. I am very familiar w sushi and this was fresh, well prepared and well served. If u want steaks, avoid this place....for sushi I would consider returning here."
"Aug 24, 2017",Kat B.,3,"First visit to Bartini Prime and had the CA roll and crab cake (based on another reviewer). CA roll made to order and decent.  Crab cake really meaty w/ large chunks,  very good. Sparkling rosé was nice. I would come again to sit on the patio.  The only negative I noticed was the strong cleaner smell inside the restaurant.  So odd, this was the 2nd restaurant  I visited in Morgantown with this strong odor; the Vintner Valley Wine Bar also must use the same stuff.  IDK, I feel like places that serve food or drink shouldn't be splashed in strong cleanser odors - that's why they lost a star.  Service friendly and food delivered promptly."
"Nov 7, 2020",Vinnie B.,4,In town to visit son playing WVU baseball. Dinner and service is phenomenal.  Food spot on. But we are from KY. And we are used to being bent over on bourbon prices. $77 for EH Taylor?? Dear god. It actually made me order water.  Pitiful - 3x secondary pricing puts you in the penalty box.
"Mar 14, 2015",Bryan G.,5,"Love this place.  It has a really cool modern feel to it on the inside.  Take your pick from bar seating, tables, or even couches for a nice romantic night with the better half.  I did that, it gives off an inviting comfortable vibe. I was there on a Thursday and the music was slower and chill, kinda what i was looking for on a Thursday.  Friday and Saturday nights feature revolving live bands. The drinks are good and the selection is huge, although a bit pricy.  Most specialty mixed drinks were around $10.  I tried a sushi roll and it was downright amazing. I think it was called the dank roll, it was a shrimp tempura topped with crab.  The blend of flavors and sauces was spot on.  My coworker who's not a sushi fan tried a piece and liked it so much he ordered one himself.  Yeah, it's that good. I guess my only real complaint is there's not one of these in pittsburgh where I'm from.  I'd go out of my way to return to bartini.  Check it out!"
"Apr 26, 2017",jessy s.,3,So Bartini is cute and trendy with a nice patio for warmer days. We went for happy hour and I thought the happy hour selection was eh...none of us ended up choosing anything on that menu. Food was attractively displayed and service was initially helpful and then vanished for a LONG time. If your going for drinks try the creamsicle!
"Jan 29, 2019",Brittany L.,4,"While staying in Morgantown for work a few nights, we decided to try Bartini Prime after the great Yelp reviews. We had a group of 7 for dinner. We started off with the mozzarella logs with marinara sauce and the nachos with shredded chicken for our appetizers. Both were fantastic! Our group had a variety of sushi entrees and I chose the 10 ounce filet along with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The filet was one of the best that Ive had in a long time, the meat was extremely tender and the taste was fantastic. Our whole group thoroughly enjoyed our food. I took a star off my review because the service left alot of room for improvement from the sloppy dropping of plates onto our table to not being checked on after receiving our entrees until she brought the check over. The place was busy for a weeknight but there was plenty of staff working. I would definitely return for the food!"
"Oct 26, 2019",Jim U.,5,Excellent meal! Very modern yet inviting decor. Interesting mix of high end steaks and sushi. My table had some of both and no one was disappointed. Best wine list in Morgantown! The chocolate brownie dessert was more than our table of 4 could finish.  Good service rounds out the review.

"Jul 12, 2019",Cj U.,3,"The crab cake was good, the steak just ok. The bread was good, the Mac n cheese was pretty decent. Unfortunately, the reviews are right as far as the prices and sleazy attire go. The women servers made me uncomfortable. Butt cheeks were hanging out (you could see the a$$ crease the to thighs), thigh gaps with exposed thigh rub and a tiny piece of fabric covering the private area and thongs. Seriously, it looked like nightclub goers. Poor taste for such an expensive restaurant.  The sleazy attire was a common theme for most the servers :("
"Jul 27, 2019",Rick E.,2,"Took in an early Friday evening snack at Bartini Prime. Main dining room was ice cold and we asked Maitre D to put us on patio outside. Took about 5 minutes to clear a table and move outside. The temperature in the main dining room was below 60 and air conditioning blowing very hard.After seeing who was gathering on the patio all dressed in black, we realized it was a dance club masking as a restaurant. Could also tell that by the nachos appetizer that we got with prime filet steak added. Nachos were okay, cheese was mozzarella, prime filet was burnt with the consistency of shoe leather. If a place has Prime in their name...Did not stay for club scene, but the kitchen closes at 10, place closes at 3; do the math."
"Mar 30, 2019",Billy S.,5,John and Vlad are always ready to make anyone feel like a regular. The staff is quick to build a relationship just not a food or drink order. The Kobe appetizer is a diamond in the rough on a menu filled with top flight choices.
"Oct 7, 2013",Danielle P.,5,"I am very excited this place came to Morgantown! Modern decor with some Parisian art flair, outdoor seating/bar option, and a stage for live music behind the indoor bar make this place great for anyone. The drinks and food are well priced for what you get. The Flirtini was delicious and strong. The classic Cosmo was on point, as well! My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and only 15 bucks! They also obliged my food allergy requests with ease. The bartender was so incredibly friendly and attentive, too! This is a great place for an after work drink, special event or anything in between. Can't wait to go back!"
"Aug 10, 2019",Hannah D.,2,When I go here I only sit at the bar and I have been here multiple times and the food has always been great but the service is hit or miss. This last time I was there the service was TERRIBLE. She was the most miserable bartender I have ever encountered in my LIFE. I don't know if I'll be returning because I never want to deal with her again.
"Sep 14, 2016",Amie F.,4,Great atmosphere with live music and a variety of cuisine. The food was exceptionally good with very large portions. The Greek Sampler appetizer was phenomenal. I definitely recommend it.
"Nov 10, 2017",Karl K.,3,This place was ok. Waited about 25 minutes for a table. Had the crab soup which was tasty and a shrimp tempura bowl which wasn't that good. The guacamole in it was going bad and the vegetables were soggy like there were old but kept in a cold fridge. Overall the restaurant was overpriced but the waitress was very nice.
"Jun 18, 2020",Dan R.,3,All I can say is have come because everone said it was great and all. It was okay but between the server being standoffsh and u could tell she was not happy to be there. And that they ran out of all the fllites are sold out was a disapooment. They food it self was okay was not total wowed about it. Not sure why everone speaks so hi off its it was okay but nothing to me that wants to rush back there again
"Sep 4, 2020",Nick C.,5,"Came here with my parents when they visited me at school last year. The food was really good and my parents loved it. My parents are albanian immigrants who moved to new york, so they'd know real fine dining when they see it. You'd expect a restaurant in Morgantown to not be as good as one you'd find somewhere in new york, but bartini is really good. My mom and i fell in love with the crab cakes n still talk about it to this day. We still haven't found any place with better crab cakes so, definitely try those if you haven't already. Delicious, and seemingly fresh food with a great, not too formal environment. Looking forward to coming again"
"Dec 14, 2017",Olivia H.,5,My favorite happy hour spot in Morgantown! The atmosphere is always upscale and inviting and is truly beautiful for parties or a night out. The Dang sushi roll is amazing as well as the coconut shrimp tacos. They are very accommodating to large groups and take reservations. Never had a bad meal here

"Dec 8, 2018",Lori C.,5,"This is the best steakhouse in Morgantown.  Great atmosphere, great staff, and melt in your mouth steaks!In addition to the superb steaks, our birthday party of eight especially enjoyed the crab cake, lobster Mac and cheese, bacon wrapped au gratin potatoes, and asparagus, each cooked to perfection!  Our appetizers and salads were delicious, as well.  After filling our bellies, the bill came and I was somewhat shocked at how inexpensive our experience was.  We ate a big city meal for a small city price.  Kudos to you, Bartini Prime!"
"Oct 22, 2016",Jerry H.,5,"Great food, great service!!! Special ordered my favorite sushi, salmon and avocado roll, which was not on the menu and they hit it out of the ball park. I know, that's not a hard  one to do; but, it was as good as any other I've had.We got the crab cakes and the rib eye with bleu cheese crumbles. Wonderful, even for West Virginia ! And that's from a B'more guy. Could of used a little mustard; but, that's one's taste.The service was great, the owner, Justin, greeted us and made very welcome on a busy Saturday night.Kudos, Bartini's we'll be back!!!"
"May 16, 2015",Anna P.,5,"I have been here a few times with my girlfriends and have had a great experience every time! I even brought my family here for my graduation weekend. Nicole is the best waitress and always gets our drinks very quickly :-) .. Happy hour is half off all Martinis from 4-7pm and live music in Friday's and Saturdays starts at 8pm. Great atmosphere with bar seating, regular tables, or couches to sit inside or outside! They also just added sushi to the menu... It is pricy compare to most places in morgantown, but the modern atmosphere is worth it. Their sliders are really tasty as well. Great place for a date night."
"Feb 15, 2019",Sreyas M.,3,"The highlight of this place for sure is their special steak preparations named after WVU athletes and coaches. They are really delicious and five star for preparation. Good tender meat if you're not a spoiled Waygu fanatic. The sushi is really good. What we ordered was very fancy and rich, so don't order it if you only like traditional Japanese sushi. Decent service. The price point excellent for what they offer. A full meal with sushi, appetizer, salad and steaks for two people tops out just over $100. Salad selection was great and the salads were delicious and pretty unique. Noticed they had PEI mussels on the menu but didn't get them. The only reason this is not a 4 star review is that the accompaniment we got, ""lobster Mac and cheese"" was very underwhelming and was actually lobster penne n cheese. It makes a difference and it seems like the attention is not on the sides. Bartini, if you read these, focus more on your sides or cut out the ones you can't make all the time. You remain the go-to fancy spot at a reasonable price point in Morgantown. It's a great treat to eat here!"
"Feb 14, 2017",Caitlyn M.,5,This place has great happy hour specials and live music. ThIs is the go to place for drinks and appetizer sized portions after work. And my favorite part is that they have blue cheese stuffed olives. YUM!!
"May 24, 2017",Jennifer S.,5,"Hands down the best crab cakes I have ever had!  This is the only reason they received a 5. The ambience is very good.  Food is very pricey. Entrees are not served w/ sides, but the sides they offer are too big for one person. I got two crab cakes on a plate for $26.  Service was lack luster.  The two girls working the bar ignored me the entire time and talked to their friends, who may have been off-duty employees."
"May 21, 2019",Celia L.,5,"I loved the ambience of this place! The second I stepped in I felt like I was in a modern, upscale restaurant that was still casual enough to be inviting. The wall of wine bottles was cool, and I appreciated all of the modern and artsy decor. It was kid friendly (our party had a kid), but it wasn't the vibe I got from the restaurant. I feel like they had a decent selection of beer/drinks to choose from, which was nice, because I love to try new things! The important thing here, though, is that the food is delicious! A friend ordered their crab dip, and honestly, it was the best I've ever had. I would've been satisfied just having that as a meal! Another friend ordered the salmon and was so pleased with it; she thought it was cooked to perfection. I got the butternut squash ravioli, and it was SUCH a great choice. The waitress told me it was seasonal, so I was excited to try it. The filling was flavorful, but not overpowering, and the cream sauce went with it perfectly. Two of us ordered the butter cake with berries, which was extremely dense, but I thought it tasted great. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for something in town that's a little nicer but still decently laid-back."
"Feb 8, 2017",Carrie B.,5,"Awesome food, strong drinks, friendly staff and a great atmosphere.  I would definitely come back the next time I am in Morgantown."
"Jun 22, 2017",Sasa T.,5,"We have eaten dinner here twice and it's been great both times. We had the sushi appetizer and it was delicious. Steaks are great. Crab cakes were good. Nice wine list. Good service. It seems a little weird because it's basically a bar with a dance floor, but the eating areas are very nice. Highly recommend."
"Apr 19, 2017",Brittney N.,5,The food was excellent! We had sushi and it was great. The seafood and steak was no exception. The staff were all really friendly. We will definitely be coming back. Overall a great dining experience

"May 30, 2017",Luke N.,5,Hands down the best restaurant in north central wv. I'm a fan of sushi and steaks and they have a quality selection of both. The steaks are to die for and the sushi is the top 3 I've ever had and I've had sushi all around the United States. If you are looking for a nice meal at the end of the day or need a place for a special event. I can't recommend them enough.
"Nov 9, 2019",Chelsea M.,2,"Not all it's hyped up to be. I am a WVU alum and came back to Morgantown with my family for a football game. We wanted to have a nice dinner and seeing how EVERYTHING has changed I thought Bartini Prime would be the place for a nice steak dinner... WRONG!! I ordered the filet and my Mom got the strip. BOTH were over cooked... I ordered my filet medium rare, how on earth you over cook a FILET to medium well is BEYOND me. To top it off, we ordered brussel sprouts as a side, they were beyond burnt! You couldn't even identify what they were. Listen, I get it, it's a football game weekend, its crazy. We kindly told our waitress about the issues. She says she'll comp something on the menu. They comp brussel sprouts, the CHEAPEST things on the menu. Our bill was over $200 and they comp $6. When we talked to the manager, his response ""I didnt know about the steaks!"" Ummm buddy - as a manager for a bill this size making an appearance to apologize would've gone a LONG way. I think its safe to say, we would NOT recommend and we will NEVER go back."
"Oct 15, 2017",Patrick H.,1,"The place is extremely over rated. Poor staff. Had reservations and were seated in the last outdoor table, wasn't asked if we wanted outside seating. Server was poor and inattentive to us, it seemed only as an afterthought. We ordered appetizers and she came back ten minutes later and said the kitchen sold out of them. We ordered a different appetizer and our meal. The appetizers didn't come out until 45 minutes after we were seated. By that time the temperature started to drop, where it was chilly outside.Spoke to the manager, he said ""The kitchen is slammed"". It was homecoming weekend, a restaurant of that proposed standing, one would think to make sure they where prepared for the rush of people. Poor service and planning by the restaurant doesn't excuse it. They still charge the same high prices.In the end it was extremely upsetting and it ruined a night that was supposed to be fun. The manager did comp the meal, by that time it was too late.I will not go back there. During the football season I mostly likely would spend over $1600.That is revenue is lost. I hope other people follow the same remedy.If I could give it Zero stars, I would."
"Aug 21, 2016",Kathy M.,2,My husband and I went on a Saturday night and were surprised by the $5/each cover for a DJ?? But we wanted to sit outside and enjoy the night so whatever.  It's $10. After sitting there for about ten minutes and no service we thought something must be wrong. When we asked where our server was they said there were no servers!! So not only did we pay $10 to listen to basically a blaring radio we were going to have to go to the bar as well? Not sure how that is considered upscale? We promptly left. Not worth the bother.
"Feb 11, 2018",Jonathan B.,2,"Prices are kind of insane. Last night was only the second time I have been to Bartini; the first being in 2015. It has changed a lot since then: higher prices, less lounge areas and it appears the stage is gone (not sure on their music scene anymore). It's still a very nice and clean establishment but I probably won't be back for another 3 years lol."
"Sep 23, 2017",Lisa G.,3,"Sadly, we never made it to a table. The most unorganized nightmare at the hostess stand.  We stood in line for twenty minutes while the young hostess looked at us while the owner and countless servers bounced back and forth.  Please say something... ""so sorry we have a large party but you are important to us.  Let me take your name, feel free to get a drink at the bar..."""
"Sep 10, 2019",Faye V.,3,"The nachos here are delish! And of course, love the cocktails. Some of the stuff is hit or miss though. My husband and I both enjoy the dinner overall though!"
"Mar 6, 2017",Theresa K.,5,"Excellent steak cooked perfect with blue cheese crumbles on top.   I wish I had a larger appetite because the sushi guys looked bored,  but a 15 oz ribeye does me in.   Sushi choices looked awesome.  Will try again next time thru.    Really close to wvu.    Hotel right by stadium."
"Mar 28, 2018",Jim J.,5,The happy hour is good with $3 house wines and $6 martinis. However ordered a cosmopolitan but it was more like a vodka margarita. Just could taste sour mix which should not be in a cosmo. Other than that Tuesday nights are sushi night with half price rolls all night. Spicy tuna roll was good as was the ribeye steak. Overall good experience and would return again but would avoid the martini.
"Nov 12, 2016",Lauren R.,2,"Came here to eat with my boyfriend and was treated like a second class citizen based on the fact that we were a ""younger couple."" We weren't given a drink menu but when we finally were able to order a drink they didn't even card us. Sad when the serve is so bad that it makes you forget how good of a meal you had."

"Feb 21, 2019",Mike S.,5,Had a group business dinner here and all I can say is the service was outstanding. The waitress was superior and very attentive to the group. Food was fantastic and cooked to order. This place will be my go to for further business dinners
"Feb 14, 2016",Caitlyn A.,5,"This is my favorite meal in town! Excellent food, every time... And live music! Truffle fries -to die forBartini chips-a must Guacamole burger- scrumptious Bone in Ribeye- AMAZING! I've been here for a date night, a night out, networking events, birthday parties, a baby shower... Stage list goes on. Anything you need, they will accommodate. If you haven't been here, you're missing out :)"
"May 11, 2018",jennifer l.,5,Awesome experience! Came here to celebrate my sister's graduation. Friendly staff. Great food. Great drinks. Hidden gem in Morgantown!
"Oct 18, 2016",Zachary T.,5,"I must say I eat here often. At first I came for the atmosphere, and to have a few drinks for happy hour with friends especially on sushi night, But this restaurant has gotten really good. The management and ownership have their staff whipped into shape, the staff are friendly and personable and take extremely good care of you while not being intrusive to the table. But the reason I'm writing this is the food has become in my opinion the best around. The steaks are perfect, the bacon mac m cheese side dish, prefect. They serve a grilled bacon app that has to be tried.  What I crave is the porterhouse for two that is carved at the table. I really enjoy it here it's a good restaurant."
"Aug 23, 2018",Rrr Z.,5,"Love Bartini Prime! The atmosphere is chic, yet comfortable, and the food is amazing. Favorite dishes: the bacon slab, the cobb salad, the huggy bear to share, ANY sushi roll, and the butter cake. Staff is friendly and fun too!"
"Aug 18, 2016",Sharon S.,5,An upscale bar with  great food.  My boyfriend and I ate there last night.  The food was so good.  I had the crab cakes and they were full of flavor and lumps of crab.  He had the Maryland Crab Soup -  it was well-seasoned and tasty.  This rivaled any meal that I have eaten in Annapolis.  The service was good too.
"Apr 11, 2015",Zeeshan S.,4,"Really fun place! Great apps, great happy hour deals and the service is wow! Great place to get your night started, I'll have to try the sushi the next time I go"
"Nov 24, 2018",Beck R.,1,"Wish I could give less than one star, Average food with bad service and they really don't care."
"Sep 15, 2017",Snow K.,1,"Um, what?  Let's start with the name.  ""Bartini""?  Even if that's way too cute for it's own good, we gave it a shot on a Friday night, but stopped as we heard ""Back That Ass Up.""  LOL, no.  I don't think there's a way to take this place seriously."

"May 23, 2016",Doug H.,4,"Good sushi.  Tempura shrimp and tuna wrapped in  cucumber roll was excellent!  Preference on the sashimi.  Dirty Martini was smooth, Moscow mule was excellent.  Witney was friendly and helpful."
"Apr 17, 2017",Susi Q.,4,"This place has a good ambience and atmosphere, but the food is overpriced and they really nickel and dime you.  Steak was good, but nothing special.  We wanted fries with the meal, but the restaurant was ""out of fries."" They didn't offer anything else, except a baked potato for extra $$. I wasn't going to pay extra for an already $35 meal and then you charge for substituting something your restaurant ran out of? Pretty cheap in my opinion.  Martinis were delicious, but still expensive.  Probably won't be coming back too often due to the pricing, but if they have any specials on the food or for the happy hours, I'd check it out again.  The 4-star rating is mostly for the food, otherwise it would be lower."
"May 21, 2015",Trudi B.,5,Really great ADULT upscale bar.  A rarity in a college town.  The chicken nachos are the best. Broad wine list and excellent specialty drinks.  Live entertainment on the weekends.  Sometimes gets a bit loud depending on where you're seated.  Wait staff is friendly and efficient.
"Aug 2, 2014",Mark K.,5,Outside seating great food and very sociable service enjoy your cigar with no hassle   Great food super cocktails and great bands
"Mar 30, 2015",Mike R.,2,"I Gave this place a second chance after a first bad experience and had to walk out this time. The sushi chef was not wearing gloves, doing dishes, and touching all of the fish with his bare hands while having a huge tobacco dip in. Extremely disappointed because menu sounded good and my girlfriend and I love trying new sushi places. We sat for over 15 minutes, without even getting drink orders, manager was rude as always and this was yet again a very poor experience"
"Jul 15, 2014",John B.,3,"Go for the drinks, not the food. Needs to figure out if it's for real adults or ogling men."
"Apr 12, 2014",Amin A.,4,"Spacious area with a very warm vibe, has a good setup for entertainment. Drink selection is good, but the Martini's are pretty good, overall this bar is a little pricier compared to the others, definitely a step up from the ones downtown, Also the location is prime as it is very near some good late night eateries."
"Jun 7, 2015",McKenzie S.,5,Went in with my mother and Aunt and we had a blast! Definitely not for college students. It's expensive and an overall older crowd!
"Jul 7, 2013",Teresa T.,5,Super cool place. The band playing Friday night was awesome and the staff was very friendly. Food was terrific. Everyone enjoyed their Dirty Martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives!
"Jun 22, 2015",Brittany C.,5,"I love Bartini!  Hump day is my favorite day to go.  Martinis and sliders are all amazing.  Sliders come with homemade potato chips too, which are really great.  Love the outdoor seating area."

"Nov 5, 2017",Hannah K.,3,"The hostesses were absolutely confused. They told us our wait would be 10 minutes. It was twenty,  and they ended up seating several people who came in after us before seating us at a table that had been open and cleared since we came in. We almost left. They didn't seem capable of doing much without the help of a manager.The food was very good-my dad got steak and loved it-I got the mussels and while they were a bit heavy on the black pepper they were still enjoyable. They were out of bread to eat the sauce with which was disappointing, but the food came quickly despite how busy they were.Our personal server was great, but I interacted with the hosts and bartenders as well who were unfriendly, never smiled, etc. I was also really confused by the fact that the only people working in FOH besides the older male managers were young, thin, attractive, white women, many of them in skimpy clothes. I'm not conservative but this just bothers me. Is this Hooters, or does this restaurant only engage in discriminatory hiring practices based on looks over experience or capability?The environment was also kind of weird. It was a high class restaurant mixed with a club. Don't go there if you're looking for a quiet meal. The music was blaring."
"Dec 12, 2016",Alicia M.,5,Love this place! Amazing food and amazing service! Lindsey was our waitress and she was very nice and did a great job. The martinis are always on point here. I have never gotten a drink that I didn't enjoy. I highly recommend it. The dessert is yummy too!
"Apr 19, 2015",Charity W.,2,"Bartini has an open and modern feel to it. They have two bars to choose from for seating and high tables inside with low tables on the patio, with a few lounge chairs and couches. It was a pleasant night and the doors were open so the main bar and patio bar were open to one another. The breeze was nice, however, many patrons were smoking on the patio and the smoke just blew right into the dinning room. We were able o choose a seat right away with no wait and we were greeted by our server promptly.This is where service stopped being good. Looking around there were A LOT of people working (typical and expected for a Saturday night in a college town). However, very few of them were actually working. There was a lot of socializing and many were looking at their phones. The manager, who at least who I assume to be the manager was on the floor for most of the time so I'm not really sure that management even cares. There were some other problems with the service, which seemed to be a training problem. Our server came over several times to ask if we needed anything just as we had taken a bite, and a head shake was not good enough. She would awkwardly stand in front of us until we swallowed, until we could verbally answer. Taking our drink orders the server didn't know what Disaronno was and I overheard the bartender and he didn't know either. I don't have a problem with them not having the product, but it would have been nice if they would have had product awareness and could suggest a similar product. My husband ordered a bottled beer and it came to the table already poured into a glass. I thought this was nice, but he said he would have preferred to do the pour himself or at least have been asked. We ordered two plates of sliders and an appetizer of calamari. Granted we ordered everything at the same time, but everything came out at the same time, which is always annoying. The food was delivered by a food runner, who came out of the kitchen and had no idea where to go. Again, not really his fault, but definitely a breakdown in communication. The crab cake sliders were just ok, there was lots of crab in the cake, which was nice. But the whole thing felt a little slimy. Maybe toasting the bun or letting the crab cake crisp would add some texture. The meatball sliders had a lot of flavor. The ricotta pesto was very good, although piled a bit too high on the slider. The serve sliders with homemade chips, which were cut very thin and cooked perfectly. My only complaint would be that they were a bit over salted. The prices were a bit high too for sliders and chips, but I expected this from other reviews and friends. We don't get a date often too often, but we probably wont be returning here when we do."
"Mar 24, 2017",Dan O.,5,"Looking for a prime (yes, real prime) Angus steak? This is the place. The steaks are just perfect; large sides. Can't go wrong. Full-service bar as well."
"Feb 22, 2017",Clark L.,5,"I took a large group to Bartini Prime on a Friday night. I called ahead and reserved the large private room upstairs, it included its own bar, TV and bathroom. Our party arrived 45 minutes ahead of our reservation and the staff was still ready to take us. They provided great service all night and the food was great. Our group really enjoyed our experience and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fun atmosphere. If you're looking to host an event ask for Kari, she's great!"
"Feb 15, 2015",Toby W.,4,"We enjoyed drinks and appetizers here. We had oysters and bruschetta.  Good atmosphere and attentive staff. Chilled by the fireplace. It can get a little loud when the music plays, but not overbearing. Eric Lewis is a good musician to listen to during adult-drinks."
"Apr 26, 2016",Grant B.,3,"They appear to be trying to be a bit of everything - steak, burgers, Maryland crab cakes... And Sushi?  I had the caprese salad that was heavy on the balsamic but overall quite decent. For an entree I had the grilled salmon that said it was sushi grade but pretty sure it was not. Had a side of asparagus that was cooked quite perfectly. The salmon was too dry on the outside and too raw inside... Maybe it was sushi grade but if so it should have been better. My biggest complaint was the timing of the food delivery. The salad came within about 3 minutes of ordering... Ok it was Tuesday and not too busy. But then the entree arrived before I was done my salad. That's not acceptable. As a single diner I had not given any indication I was in a hurry, so why the rush?  And any good restaurant knows if you draw out the meal a bit likely you will get additional drink orders and maybe a desert and coffee out of your guests. No chance. I wasn't giving them more money. There are a couple of other great places in Morgantown that I will gladly revisit time and time again. The wait staff and host were very pleasant so that brings it up from 2 to 3 stars."
"Dec 19, 2014",Justine T.,5,Sushi with nice drink= end your perfect day. I am giving this bar 5 star is just because of the sushi! Recently they open up a sushi bar from 4-9pm. They serve variety sushi that you will like it! Highly recommend!
"Jan 31, 2014",Kris K.,5,"Nice drinks, great food and awesome staff. Would definitely make this a must visit for Morgantown."
"Oct 8, 2016",Lisa A.,1,"The service was slow....took 45 minutes to get appetizers. We ate our dinner and then we were brought the bill without asking if we wanted anything else, not even dessert.

"Jan 2, 2016",CD I.,2,"It should have been a sign when we were there only ones eating dinner @  6:30pm on a Saturday night. Martini's had no taste of alcohol... Good flavor, just lacking the most important part... And at $10 a glass... You shouldn't have to wonder if they forgot the alcohol.  Burger was sub par at best. Great atmosphere and location. Just not worth the $$ for the drinks and food. One and done. Wont be back..."
"Jun 9, 2016",Stacy H.,5,Great atmosphere!  Service was fast and friendly and food was excellent!  We were seated outside at the bar...bartender was more than a helpful and attentive. I believe her name was Marissa.  Music was enjoyable with a relaxed and fun atmosphere. We will definitely be returning again!
"Jun 8, 2016",Kerry W.,5,"This bar has it all from atmosphere , live music , great drinks , and a menu that extends from sushi to burgers.  It is clean , the waitstaff is professional and friendly.  They are knowledgeable and accommodating to allergies .  Love the outdoor patio regardless of the season! Best adult bar/ nightclub in Morgantown !"
"Oct 23, 2015",Alyssa W.,5,"Bartini has come under new ownership and the food is amazing! The Maryland lump crab cakes are perfection! The food quality is fantastic and you will not leave hungry! They also offer delicious drinks, and live entertainment."

"Feb 9, 2015",Sharon M.,1,Spent two nights at the Hilton Garden Inn. Couldn't sleep either night because the bass from this restaurant was thumping so loud. Keep in mind the two buildings are almost a football field apart and it was winter so the doors weren't open. Complained to staff at hotel and was told they know about the problem but the management at Bartinis has not resolved the issue. In Morgantown all the time but will never go here. Not good neighbors. Can only imagine the hearing damage taking place inside.
"Dec 22, 2016",S M.,3,"I have come here many many times.  Usually the food is stellar and the drinks are creative.  I have been pleased with the decision to remove the stage and the live ""music"" and make it more a ""restaurant"".  However tonight I was disappointing.  A friend was held up at work so I needed to find a place that was open late.  I checked online and it said open until midnight.  I thought perfect.  So I went to get a table and the manager said sorry the kitchen just closed.  This would have been helpful information to have posted online if the kitchen is not going to stay open until closing.  So then I ordered a martini that I have gotten there many many times.  A lemon drop.  A simple martini.  The bartender made it differently than anyone ever has there and it tasted bitter.  Not sour.  BITTER.   So i said this to the waitress and she attempted to argue that it was the way they always make them.  I ended up just leaving.  I was very disappointed.    I have never had a bad experience there until tonight."
"Oct 1, 2014",J L.,1,The owner pulled a fast one and changed happy hour prices to 6pm. instead of 8pm.  Bad move.  We are moving our happy hour to Primanti Brothers where there is the same drink special only theirs extends to 7 PM.  $1.00 pizza slices to boot!
"May 16, 2016",Pete C.,5,"I went to Bartini this past weekend following my cousins graduation from WVU and wanted to express how great my experience was. As a graduate of WVU I lived in Morgantown for a long time and the restaurants were always average at best but now the town is growing and Bartini is a top notch option when visiting MOTOWN.  As a sushi lover I always remember looking all over for good sushi, this is it...definitely best in town, we got a few rolls for the table to share and they were all great and very fresh. We took the advice of our awesome server (I forget her name but she was cute) and ordered the special rolls she suggested. The entrees were liked all around, personally I got a mammoth bone in ribeye cooked perfectly mid rare as I asked and seasoned to perfection. I didn't even need steak sauce.  As this was late on a Saturday night the place was very busy yet the food and drinks were always on time with no wait, the manager even came by with one of our drink orders and also checked on us to make sure everything was perfect.  The cute waitress(wish I remembered her name) was amazing, extremely friendly, and gave us suggestions for good new sites to see on the last day of our little trip.  After a long dinner we were going to leave to go downtown to other local bars but the atmosphere was so good here most of our group actually stayed and shut the place down haha. The general manager actually came up to me noticing I was there for so long and bought a round for everyone I was with, thanking me for staying. A+++ all around for service/food quality/liquor selection. Can't wait for football season to hit this place up to watch the Mountaineers! Bartini is the premier dining and entertainment location in Morgantown."
